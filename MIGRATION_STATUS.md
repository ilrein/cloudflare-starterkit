# Cloudflare Workers Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] Installed Cloudflare Workers dependencies (@remix-run/cloudflare, @cloudflare/workers-types, wrangler)
- [x] Updated TypeScript configuration for Cloudflare Workers types
- [x] Converted package manager from npm to bun

### Phase 2: Build System
- [x] Created dual-target Vite configuration supporting both Node.js and Cloudflare Workers
- [x] Implemented dynamic entry point in `app/entry.server.tsx` with environment detection
- [x] Added Cloudflare-specific build scripts to package.json

### Phase 3: Database Migration
- [x] Chose Drizzle ORM + D1 strategy for database operations
- [x] Created Drizzle schema matching Shopify session requirements (`app/db/schema.ts`)
- [x] Implemented database client with environment-aware switching (`app/db/client.ts`)
- [x] Built DrizzleSessionStorage adapter implementing Shopify's SessionStorage interface
- [x] Updated `app/shopify.server.ts` to use environment-aware session storage
- [x] Generated initial database migration for sessions table
- [x] Created Sessions table in development SQLite database

### Phase 4: Configuration
- [x] Created generic `wrangler.jsonc` configuration suitable for public Shopify apps
- [x] Added database migration scripts to package.json
- [x] Fixed Remix development server configuration for bun compatibility

## üîÑ Current Status

### Working Components
- **Development Environment**: Shopify CLI + Node.js runtime with intelligent fallback
- **Production Build**: Cloudflare Workers-compatible build target  
- **Session Storage**: Smart environment-aware adapter with automatic fallback
- **Database Schema**: Sessions table created and ready for both environments

### Session Storage Strategy (Unified)
- **Development**: Drizzle + Local D1 database (via wrangler dev)
- **Production**: Drizzle + Remote D1 database (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Consistency**: Single ORM (Drizzle) and database type (D1) across all environments

### Architecture Benefits ‚úÖ
- **Simplified Stack**: Removed better-sqlite3 and Prisma dependencies
- **Environment Parity**: Development mirrors production exactly
- **Single Source of Truth**: One database schema, one ORM, one migration system
- **Developer Experience**: `bun run dev` now uses wrangler with local D1

## üéØ Ready for Testing

### Next Steps

#### 1. Create D1 Database
```bash
# Create D1 database in Cloudflare
wrangler d1 create shopify-app-sessions

# Copy the database ID from output and update wrangler.jsonc:
# Replace "your-d1-database-id-here" with the actual ID

# Apply migrations to D1
bun run db:migrate:d1
```

#### 2. Test Production Deployment
```bash
# Build for Cloudflare Workers
bun run build:cloudflare

# Deploy to staging environment
bun run deploy:cloudflare:staging

# Test the deployed app functionality
```

#### 3. OAuth Flow Testing
- Verify Shopify authentication works on Cloudflare Workers
- Test session creation and retrieval
- Confirm webhook handling

#### 4. Performance Validation
- Test app performance and session management
- Monitor D1 database operations
- Verify bundle size is within Workers limits

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Development (now uses wrangler + local D1)
bun run dev

# Build for Cloudflare Workers
bun run build:cloudflare

# Deploy to Cloudflare environments
bun run deploy:cloudflare          # Default
bun run deploy:cloudflare:staging  # Staging
bun run deploy:cloudflare:production # Production
```

### Database Commands
```bash
# Generate new migrations from schema
bun run db:generate

# Apply migrations to local D1 (development)
bun run db:migrate:d1

# Apply migrations to remote D1 (production)
bun run db:migrate:d1:remote

# Push schema directly to D1 (alternative to migrations)
bun run db:push:d1

# Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection
bun run db:studio
```

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added Cloudflare dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Dual-target build configuration
- `app/entry.server.tsx` - Environment-aware server entry point
- `app/shopify.server.ts` - Session storage environment detection
- `app/db/schema.ts` - Drizzle schema for sessions
- `app/db/client.ts` - Database client factory
- `app/db/session-storage.ts` - DrizzleSessionStorage adapter
- `wrangler.jsonc` - Cloudflare Workers configuration
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle ORM configuration

## üöÄ Migration Success

The Shopify app is now fully prepared for Cloudflare Workers deployment while maintaining backwards compatibility with the existing Shopify CLI development workflow. The session storage system can seamlessly switch between Prisma (development) and Drizzle+D1 (production) based on the runtime environment.
